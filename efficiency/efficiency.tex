\section{Formalism}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probably say something about the rates we're measuring
    \item This means we need to find the efficiency
    \item MC sample
    \item Talk about phase space dimensionality
    \item Phase space parameterisation
\end{itemize}

\section{Reweighting Strategy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find efficiency by reweighting MC to AmpGen
    \item MC and AmpGen samples
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Want a single reweighter to reweight both RS and WS
              \item Need to have the right amount of each
              \item Use the amplitude models to find out the proportion of RS and WS that were generated
              \item Algebra
          \end{itemize}
    \item Split data into time bins
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Below lowest bin, just throw away because time weight would be too high...
              \item Might be possible to just ignore phsp efficiency for this bin? or do an average or something?
              \item In each time bin - 5d phsp BDT * 1d histogram division
          \end{itemize}
    \item BDT Reweighter in each time bin
    \item Histogram division in each time bin
\end{itemize}

\section{Validation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Projections
    \item Alternate projections
    \item Classifiers
    \item Z scatters
\end{itemize}
