\subsection{Parameter Counting}
Eqs \ref{Gamma eqn minus} and \ref{Gamma eqn plus} are used to measure $\gamma$.
Taking $\Gamma_D$, $x$ and $y$ from external input, we find there are three unknown parameters that are the same in all regions of phase space ($\gamma$, $r_B$ and $\delta_B$) and three parameters that are different between regions ($r_{D, \Omega}$ and two real components of $Z_\Omega^f$).
We therefore have $3N + 3$ unknowns for $N$ regions of phase space.
Fitting to Eq. \ref{amplitudeRatio} in each region gives us $2N$ constraints; Eqs. \ref{Gamma eqn minus} and \ref{Gamma eqn plus} provide a further $2N$ constraints.
We therefore have $4N$ constraints for $3N + 3$ unknowns; we need at least $N\geq 3$ phase space bins to extract all parameters from data.

In principle, any binning scheme can be used to divide the final state phase space into regions.
However, recent developments in $D\rightarrow K \pi \pi \pi$ amplitude models[TODO] enable us to make a model-informed binning in order to make best use of the data.
By binning the data according to the phase difference between the DCS and CF amplitude models at each point,
we find higher coherence in each bin than if we were integrating over the phase space.
This improves the sensitivity to $\gamma$; using this binning scheme is expected to give a precision as low as 5\degree[TODO].
